{{< figure src="/images/andrew.jpg"
  title="Dr Andrew Letten (University of Queensland)"

  caption="Andrew is a Lecturer in Quantitative Biology. His research combines mathematical modeling and experiments to understand the processes regulating the stability of (micro-)ecological communities. His background is originally in plant ecology but he now works primarily on microbial systems, where there are many opportunities to bring theoretical community ecology to bear on problems of environmental and human health."

{{< figure src="/images/diego.jpg"
  title="Dr Diego Barneche (Australian Institute of Marine Science)"
  link="https://www.diegobarneche.com/"
  caption="Diego is an ecological statistician. Most of his past work focused on macroecology and ecophysiology using a mixture of theory, ecoinformatics, databases, and Bayesian statistics. He primarily studied fish, but occasionally other organisms as well. More recently he started working across multiple systems and organisms to help better inform monitoring and management/conservation of tropical marine ecology in Australia."
