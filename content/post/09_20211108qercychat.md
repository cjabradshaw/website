title: "QERC-y chat - Peer code review in ecology"

**Monday 8th of November 3:45 - 4:45pm** on [zoom](https://unimelb.zoom.us/j/3172750775?pwd=VjFEVjBtT1VUQlp1WWZlZHRoMWthZz09). Despite increasing complexity of ecological analyses and computation, as well as reliance on code to prepare, model, and visualise data, very little training or oversight of code takes place in ecology. Peer code review is a staple of other industries that rely on code, but conspicuously absent from academic research and publication. Code review has many purposes, including: pure pedagogy, error correction, and confirmation of reproducibility of reported results. But how can we implement code review? By whom, when, and how should it and can it take place? Join us for a special discussion with guests Chris Brown and Christina Buelow from Griffith University.
