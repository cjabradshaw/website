As our series of QERC-y chats gains momentum, we're very excited to release digitally remastered recordings of our first two chats.

Our [first QERC-y chat](/post/05_20210517qercychat/index.html) was all about the R tidyverse. We discussed our favourite tidyverse packages, underappreciated packages and functions, and what we love (or don't) about the tidyverse. [Listen](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tjKPEUkaSqzUc5zYCjqPifz-YZi2X2QK/view?usp=sharing) or [watch](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Jw9weEdbvUuqQp5AyUolDivb36WRHEd4/view?usp=sharing) if you want to hear more.

Our [second QERC-y chat](/post/06_20210621qercychat/index.html) took a deep dive into R package development, with special guest Dr Emi Tanaka (Monash University). We covered a whole host of package dev topics, including when (and why) to write a package, testing, documenting, licensing, publishing, and handy shortcuts. Intrigued?

Our next QERC-y chat will be on **Monday 30th of August 3:45 - 4:45pm**. In this chat, weâ€™ll tackle a tough but extremely important question: can we do a better job of teaching quantitative skills to ecologists? Stay tuned for updates!
