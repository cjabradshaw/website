**Monday 30th of August 3:45 - 4:45pm** on [zoom](https://unimelb.zoom.us/j/3172750775?pwd=VjFEVjBtT1VUQlp1WWZlZHRoMWthZz09). Despite ever increasing demand for quantitatively trained biologists, the average ecology student isn't typically enthusiastic about mathematics, statistics and coding. In our third community chat, we'll discuss quantitative training in ecology, focusing in particular on the undergrad curriculum. How do we enthuse students lacking confidence in their quantitative skills without losing those who already have a strong quantitative background? What are the constraints we face in designing quantitatively oriented courses? What measures can we take to enhance quantitative training for ecology students in Australia?

Join us to help shape the future of quantitative ecology in Australia!
