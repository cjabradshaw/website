title: "QERC-y chat - to tidy to too tidy?"

**Monday 17th of May 3:45 - 4:45pm** on [zoom](https://unimelb.zoom.us/j/3172750775?pwd=VjFEVjBtT1VUQlp1WWZlZHRoMWthZz09). 

The first of our community chats is all about tidyverse! Tidyverse is a bundle of RStudio packages that are intended to be used in harmony. Do pipes, purrr, and ggplots spark joy in your workflow? Does using tidyverse have to be all-or-nothing? In this 45 minute QERC-y chat, we will chat about our experience with tidyverse and discuss where tidiness prevails and when it falls short for R users of varying skill levels.

We invite you to join us and contribute to these discussions and help guide future events!
