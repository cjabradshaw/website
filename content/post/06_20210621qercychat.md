title: "QERC-y chat - R package dev"

**Monday 19th of July 3:45 - 4:45pm** on [zoom](https://unimelb.zoom.us/j/3172750775?pwd=VjFEVjBtT1VUQlp1WWZlZHRoMWthZz09). 
Our second community chat is all about R package development! When should your piece of code become a package? Where should that package end up (e.g., CRAN, GitHub)? When should we start writing documentation and unit tests? Do standard practices work with all applications (e.g., big data and models)? For the July QERC-y chat, we will discuss our experiences, hacks and potential trip hazards with packaging up our code.

We invite you to join us and contribute to these discussions and help guide future events!
