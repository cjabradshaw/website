2020 was a tough year. 

Our preoccupation with the pandemic, hand sanitation, and hoarding toilet paper meant that QERC was not able to run any events...but we are back! 

We are excited to introduce to you all to QERC-y chats (pronounced quirky chats) - a series of community chats where quantitative ecologists come together and engage in discussions on topics ranging from mathematics and statistics to coding practices. 

We invite you to join us and contribute to these discussions and help guide future events!

Our first event is on **Monday 17th of May 3:45 - 4:45pm**. All QERC-y chats will be hosted via zoom.
